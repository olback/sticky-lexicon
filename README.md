# Sticky Lexicon

### What is this?
'Sticky Lexicon' is a simple application written i Rust to make it easy to look up words on the fly. The idea is that you replace sticky keys with this application. This lets you select a word and just click `shift` five times and you'll have the definition and examples in you clipboard within a few seconds.

Don't use this to cheat on tests. Just don't.
